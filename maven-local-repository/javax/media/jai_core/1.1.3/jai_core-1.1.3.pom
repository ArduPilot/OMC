  <description> The Java Advanced Imaging API extends the Java 2 platform by allowing
    sophisticated, high-performance image processing to be incorporated into Java applets
    and applications. It is a set of classes providing imaging functionality beyond that of
    Java 2D and the Java Foundation classes, though it is designed for compatibility with
    those APIs. This API implements a set of core image processing capabilities including
    image tiling, regions of interest, deferred execution and a set of core image processing
    operators, including many common point, area, and frequency domain operators.
