Hello, Marco,

Thank you for your interest in our solar calculator. As a non-classified
product of the U.S. government, the solar calculator is considered to be
in the public domain. We do ask that any derivative works include a
citation of our web site, so that others interested in finding the
source may do so.

Thanks, and good luck with your project.

Sincerely,

Chris Cornwall
