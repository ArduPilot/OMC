# World Wind Java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava)

3D virtual globe API for desktop Java, developed by NASA. Provides a geographic context, complete with terrain, for 
visualizing geographic or geo-located information in 3D and 2D. World Wind Java provides high-resolution terrain and 
imagery, retrieved from remote servers automatically as needed. Developers can provide custom terrain and imagery. 
Contains a rich set of features for displaying and interacting with geographic data and representing a wide range of 
geometric objects. More information at [worldwind.arc.nasa.gov](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov).       

## Get Started

Develop a world-class World Wind application for personal computers. Setup instructions, developers guides,
API documentation and more are available at [worldwind.arc.nasa.gov](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov). This GitHub
repository contains the library source, examples and tutorials.

###### From a Windows Development Environment

- Download and extract the [Latest Release](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/releases/latest)
- Open the Command Prompt
```bash
cd [World Wind release]
run-demo.bat
```

###### From a Linux or macOS Development Environment

- Open the Terminal app
```bash
cd [World Wind release]
sh run-demo.bash
```

###### Troubleshooting
   
World Wind requires a modern graphics card with a current driver. Most display problems are caused by out-of-date 
graphics drivers. On Windows, visit your graphics card manufacturer's web site for the latest driver: NVIDIA, ATI or 
Intel. The drivers are typically under a link named Downloads or Support. If you're using a laptop, the latest drivers 
are found at the laptop manufacturer's web site.

## JOGL Native Binaries

JOGL performs runtime extraction of native binaries. Some deployment situations may not allow this because it extracts 
the binaries to the application userâ€™s temp directory. Runtime extraction can be avoided by by modifying World Wind 
Java's JOGL distribution to load native binaries directly from the library path instead of dynamically using the native 
binary JAR files as follows:
                                                                                                     
1. Extract the GlueGen and JOGL native binary JAR files for the desired platform.
   These JAR files follow the naming pattern gluegen-rt-natives-PLATFORM.jar and jogl-all-natives-PLATFORM.jar
2. Place the extracted native binaries either in the program's working directory or in a location specified as the
   library path. The following JOGL user's guide page outlines supported library path variables:
   https://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/userguide/index.html#traditionallibraryloading
3. Remove the GlueGen and JOGL native binary JAR files from your application's workspace.
   JOGL attempts to use the native binary JAR files before loading from the library path, so these files must not be
   deployed with the application.
4. When running, specify the JVM argument -Djogamp.gluegen.UseTempJarCache=false
