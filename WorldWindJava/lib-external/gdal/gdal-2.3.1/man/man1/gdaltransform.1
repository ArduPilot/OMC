.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The gdaltransform utility reprojects a list of coordinates into any supported projection,including GCP-based transformations\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-s_srs\fP \fIsrs def\fP:\fP" 1c
source spatial reference set\&. The coordinate systems that can be passed are anything supported by the OGRSpatialReference\&.SetFromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG PCS and GCSes (i\&.e\&. EPSG:4296), PROJ\&.4 declarations (as above), or the name of a \&.prj file containing well known text\&. 
.IP "\fB\fB-t_srs\fP \fIsrs_def\fP:\fP" 1c
target spatial reference set\&. The coordinate systems that can be passed are anything supported by the OGRSpatialReference\&.SetFromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG PCS and GCSes (i\&.e\&. EPSG:4296), PROJ\&.4 declarations (as above), or the name of a \&.prj file containing well known text\&. 
.IP "\fB\fB-to\fP \fINAME=VALUE\fP:\fP" 1c
set a transformer option suitable to pass to GDALCreateGenImgProjTransformer2()\&.  
.IP "\fB\fB-order\fP \fIn\fP:\fP" 1c
order of polynomial used for warping (1 to 3)\&. The default is to select a polynomial order based on the number of GCPs\&. 
.IP "\fB\fB-tps\fP:\fP" 1c
Force use of thin plate spline transformer based on available GCPs\&. 
.IP "\fB\fB-rpc\fP: \fP" 1c
Force use of RPCs\&. 
.IP "\fB\fB-geoloc\fP:\fP" 1c
Force use of Geolocation Arrays\&. 
.IP "\fB\fB-i\fP\fP" 1c
Inverse transformation: from destination to source\&. 
.IP "\fB\fB-gcp\fP\fIpixel line easting northing [elevation]\fP: \fP" 1c
Provide a GCP to be used for transformation (generally three or more are required) 
.IP "\fB\fB-output_xy\fP: \fP" 1c
(GDAL >= 2\&.0) Restrict output to 'x y' instead of 'x y z' 
.IP "\fB\fIsrcfile\fP:\fP" 1c
File with source projection definition or GCP's\&. If not given, source projection is read from the command-line -s_srs or -gcp parameters  
.IP "\fB\fIdstfile\fP:\fP" 1c
File with destination projection definition\&.  
.PP
.PP
Coordinates are read as pairs (or triples) of numbers per line from standard input, transformed, and written out to standard output in the same way\&. All transformations offered by gdalwarp are handled, including gcp-based ones\&.
.PP
Note that input and output must always be in decimal form\&. There is currently no support for DMS input or output\&.
.PP
If an input image file is provided, input is in pixel/line coordinates on that image\&. If an output file is provided, output is in pixel/line coordinates on that image\&.
.SH "Reprojection Example"

.SH "Image RPC Example"
.PP
The following command requests an RPC based transformation using the RPC model associated with the named file\&. Because the -i (inverse) flag is used, the transformation is from output georeferenced (WGS84) coordinates back to image coordinates\&.
