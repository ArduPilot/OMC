Here are some more complex and useful code examples using the SDK.

The GeoTIFF directory contains example code for extracting the GeoTIFF keys
that are stored in the metadata using libgeotiff.

PointWriter to read and write LAS files using liblas.

The SWIG directory contains the needed interface files to build SWIG based
